Description : 
Weather App â€“ React.js Internship Project
This weather application was developed as part of my React.js Developer Internship. The goal of this project was to build a simple, user-friendly web app using modern React features and integrate it with a public weather API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input.

The app allows users to search for any city and view its current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a general description of the weather. It was built entirely using React.js and styled with plain CSS to maintain simplicity and focus on functionality.

Project Objective
The primary objective of the project was to gain hands-on experience with React.js by working on a real-world application. I focused on using functional components, managing application state, and handling asynchronous API calls. The project also helped me understand the structure of a React app, routing (if added), and data flow between components.

Through this project, I also learned how to structure folders, maintain clean code, and create a responsive design that works well across different screen sizes.

Features Implemented
City Search Functionality
Users can enter the name of any city in the input field. Once submitted, the app fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the screen.

Real-Time Weather Data
The app shows the latest temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition (like cloudy, rainy, sunny) based on the city entered by the user.

Error Handling
If a user enters an invalid city name or if the API call fails, an appropriate error message is displayed on the screen without crashing the app.

Responsive Design
The layout adjusts according to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile browsers.

Clean UI
The user interface was kept minimal and clean, focusing more on usability than design-heavy features. Simple CSS was used to style the components in a readable and modern layout.

Technologies Used
React.js for building user interfaces

JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and event handling

CSS3 for basic styling and responsiveness

OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data

Git and GitHub for version control and code hosting

Skills Gained
This internship project helped me improve my skills in:

Creating reusable functional components

Using React hooks like useState and useEffect effectively

Making API calls and handling asynchronous data

Managing and updating application state

Implementing basic error handling in frontend applications

Structuring React projects for better scalability

Hosting and maintaining a project repository on GitHub

It also helped me understand how to debug issues in React, write clean and readable code, and follow a modular approach while building applications. I practiced working with real-world APIs and improved my understanding of how to handle edge cases, such as invalid input or empty API responses.

Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great learning experience and gave me a solid foundation in building practical applications using React.js. It combines many essential frontend development skills and provides a base that can be extended further by adding more features like forecast data, unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit), location-based auto-detection, and dark/light mode support.
